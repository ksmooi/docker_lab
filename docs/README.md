It walks through the installation, configuration, and building of the DeepStream image for applications that rely on video processing and AI models.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications involving real-time video analytics, such as facial recognition, object detection, and surveillance systems.

### 2. **`build_image_triton_server.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This guide covers the steps needed to build a Docker image for **Triton Inference Server**, NVIDIA's inference server designed for hosting AI models. The document details how to build and run Triton Server for deploying machine learning models across different frameworks.
   - **Use Case**: Designed for projects requiring large-scale, high-performance model inference, supporting frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX.

### 3. **`initial_dgraph_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This guide explains how to set up and initialize a **Dgraph** container, a distributed graph database known for its performance and scalability. The document covers configuration and environment settings necessary to get Dgraph up and running in Docker.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications relying on complex data relationships and graph-based queries, such as knowledge graphs and recommendation systems.

### 4. **`initial_mongodb_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This document details the steps required to initialize a **MongoDB** container, a popular NoSQL database used for document-based storage. It explains how to configure persistent storage, environment variables, and networking settings for MongoDB in Docker.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require flexible document storage, such as web applications, CMS systems, and AI-powered document analysis.

### 5. **`initial_mysql_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This guide provides instructions for setting up a **MySQL** container in Docker. It includes information on how to configure MySQL databases, users, and environment variables to initialize the service correctly.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that require a relational database with strong consistency and structured data, such as e-commerce websites, financial applications, and analytics platforms.

### 6. **`initial_postgresql_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This document explains how to configure and initialize a **PostgreSQL** container, covering key settings for database initialization, user creation, and persistent storage. It also discusses connecting PostgreSQL to other services within a Docker environment.
   - **Use Case**: Well-suited for applications that require complex relational data handling, transactions, and advanced features like JSONB storage and full-text search.

### 7. **`initial_qdrant_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This guide outlines the steps to initialize a **Qdrant** container, a high-performance vector search engine for AI-powered applications. The document explains configuration settings for vector storage and how to run Qdrant in Docker.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that require vector search capabilities, such as recommendation systems, search engines, and AI-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

### 8. **`initial_rabbitmq_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This document covers the setup and initialization of a **RabbitMQ** container, a popular message broker that facilitates asynchronous communication between services. The guide explains how to configure RabbitMQ in a Docker environment, set up management tools, and integrate with other services.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications requiring message queuing, real-time notifications, and task scheduling, such as microservices architectures and distributed systems.

### 9. **`initial_redis_container.md`**
   - **Purpose**: This guide details how to initialize a **Redis** container in Docker. Redis is an in-memory data structure store used for caching, session management, and message brokering. The document covers configuration, data persistence, and networking.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications that need fast access to data, caching, real-time analytics, or pub/sub messaging, such as web applications, gaming platforms, and real-time data processing.



## How to Use the Documentation

Each guide in the `docs` directory is tailored to provide step-by-step instructions to help you build, configure, and run Docker containers for specific services. These documents can be used independently based on the services you require in your projects.

### Example Workflow

If you are building an AI application that requires vector search and real-time data handling, you could follow:
1. **`initial_qdrant_container.md`**: To set up Qdrant for vector-based retrieval.
2. **`initial_redis_container.md`**: To configure Redis for caching and real-time data processing.
3. **`build_image_triton_server.md`**: If you need an inference server to host and serve machine learning models.

Each document includes example configurations, environment variables, and helpful tips to streamline your Docker setup.



## Conclusion

The `docs` directory provides a comprehensive resource for initializing and configuring essential services in Docker. Whether you're building a microservice architecture, an AI-powered application, or a real-time analytics platform, these guides will help you quickly deploy and manage your services using Docker.
