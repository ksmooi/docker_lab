# How to Initialize and Configure the Redis Service Using Docker Compose

This article provides a comprehensive guide for initializing and managing a Redis service in a Docker environment using a `docker/compose.yml` file. Additionally, it explains how to configure `redis.conf` for custom settings. Docker Compose simplifies the setup of Redis, enabling data persistence, external access, and easy configuration changes.

## Step 1: Verify the Directory Structure

In the provided `docker/compose.yml` file, Redis is set up to map the host directory `../host/redis:/host` and uses the volume `redis_data` for data persistence. To ensure proper setup, verify that the `docker_lab/host/redis/` directory exists in your project. This directory will be mounted into the Redis container, allowing for file interactions, such as the use of configuration files.

Example project structure:
```
docker_lab
├── docker
│   └── compose.yml
├── host
│   └── redis
│       └── redis.conf
└── tests
```

Ensure that the directory `docker_lab/host/redis/` exists for proper volume mapping.

## Step 2: Bring Up the Redis Service

To start the Redis service, use Docker Compose with the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up redis
```

This command will:
- Pull the `redis:7.4.0` image from Docker Hub if it's not already available locally.
- Start the Redis container with the configuration specified in `docker/compose.yml`, including running Redis with append-only mode enabled via the command: `["redis-server", "--appendonly", "yes"]`.
- Expose Redis on port `6379` (the default Redis port), making it accessible externally.
- Persist Redis data using the `redis_data` volume, ensuring data is retained across container restarts.

## Step 3: Verify the Redis Service is Running

After starting Redis, check that the service is running by using:

```bash
docker ps
```

This command lists the running containers. You should see the Redis container listed as `redis`. If the container is running, Redis is successfully initialized and accessible.

## Step 4: Access the Redis CLI

To interact with the running Redis instance, you can use the Redis command-line interface (CLI). Execute the following command to access the CLI within the running container:

```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```

Once inside the Redis CLI, you can run Redis commands to inspect and manage the data in the database.

Example Redis commands:
- `PING`: Test the connection to Redis.
- `SET key value`: Set a key-value pair in the database.
- `GET key`: Retrieve the value for a given key.

## Step 5: Check Data Persistence

Redis is configured to store its data in the `redis_data` volume, ensuring data is preserved between container restarts. To verify that data is being stored correctly, you can inspect the `/data` directory inside the Redis container:

```bash
docker exec -it redis ls /data
```

This command lists the contents of the `/data` directory, where Redis stores its database files. The presence of Redis data files confirms that persistence is working as expected.

## Step 6: Configure `redis.conf` for Custom Settings

Redis can be further customized by using a `redis.conf` configuration file, which allows you to modify settings such as memory limits, persistence behavior, and security features.

### Creating and Mounting a `redis.conf` File

1. **Create the `redis.conf` File**: In the `docker_lab/host/redis/` directory, create a `redis.conf` file with your desired settings. Here is an example configuration:
   
   ```ini
   # Enables append-only persistence
   appendonly yes

   # Limits Redis memory usage
   maxmemory 256mb

   # Sets a password for Redis authentication
   requirepass "mystrongpassword"
   ```

2. **Mount the Configuration File in Docker Compose**: Modify your `docker/compose.yml` to mount the `redis.conf` file into the container and instruct Redis to use it. Update the Redis service definition to include:

   ```yaml
   services:
     redis:
       image: redis:7.4.0
       container_name: redis
       networks:
         - public_net
       ports:
         - "6379:6379"
       volumes:
         - redis_data:/data
         - ../host/redis:/host
         - ../host/redis/redis.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf  # Mount redis.conf
       command: ["redis-server", "/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf"]   # Use redis.conf
   ```

This setup ensures Redis will run with your custom configuration options. The `redis.conf` file is loaded at startup, and Redis will apply the settings defined in it.

### Key Redis Configuration Options:
- **appendonly**: Enables append-only file persistence, ensuring all write operations are logged for durability.
- **maxmemory**: Limits Redis memory usage. When the limit is reached, Redis can be configured to evict the least recently used keys.
- **requirepass**: Adds a password for securing the Redis instance. Clients must provide this password to connect.

## Step 7: Stop and Restart the Redis Service

To stop the Redis container and all associated services, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml down
```

To restart Redis, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d redis
```

This will bring up the Redis container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully initialize and manage a Redis service using Docker Compose, as well as customize Redis using a `redis.conf` configuration file. The Redis container is configured with data persistence through Docker volumes, and it is accessible via the default Redis port `6379`. Additionally, the Redis CLI provides easy interaction with the database, and data is persisted even when the container is stopped or restarted.

### Key Points:
- **Directory Structure**: Ensure the host directory `docker_lab/host/redis/` exists for proper volume mapping.
- **Docker Compose Command**: Use `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up redis` to start the service.
- **Data Persistence**: Redis data is stored in the `redis_data` volume.
- **Custom Configuration**: Use a `redis.conf` file to apply advanced settings, such as memory limits and authentication.
- **Service Management**: Use `docker exec` to access Redis CLI and `docker compose -f docker/compose.yml down` to stop the service.

With Docker Compose and Redis configuration files, managing Redis becomes simple, flexible, and highly customizable in containerized environments.
